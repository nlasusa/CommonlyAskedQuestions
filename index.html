            <div id="question">WHAT IS A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION?</div>
            <div id="response">A securities fraud class action is a representative lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of
                investors who have suffered a financial loss in a particular security. Securities fraud class actions
                are civil lawsuits meaning that a person or entity (the Plaintiff) can seek to hold another person
                or entity (the Defendant) liable for violating the federal securities laws with the goal to provide
                monetary compensation to the investors (the Class) who were harmed during the relevant period
                (the Class Period). This differs from a criminal case, in which a prosecutor acts on behalf of the
                government. In a criminal case the goal is to punish the wrongdoer with imprisonment or fines
                for breaking the law. In a typical securities fraud class action, the financial loss is usually the
                result of fraudulent stock manipulation or materially false statements made to investors,
                frequently in SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, proxy statements, etc.), earnings announcements and
                other investor presentations. Once the fraud is revealed, the company’s previously artificially
                inflated stock price or other security loses a significant amount of its value, resulting in investor
                losses.<br></div>

            <div id="question">HOW LONG DO THESE CASES TYPICALLY LAST?</div>
            <div id="response">Securities fraud class action cases usually take around 2 to 4 years to be resolved,
                although each case is different and this time frame could be longer or shorter.<br></div>

            <div id="question">WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT EVENTS DURING A CASE?</div>
            <div id="response"><b>1. THE COMPLAINT IS FILED</b><br></div>
            <div id="response">A securities fraud class action begins by filing a Civil Complaint. A Civil Complaint is a
                legal document that initiates a lawsuit by a Plaintiff and informs the persons and/or entities being
                sued, the Defendants, of the claims brought against them. The Complaint, among other things,
                lays out the facts and reasons that support the Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendants.<br></div>

                <br>

            <div id="response"><b>2. THE APPOINTMENT OF LEAD PLAINTIFF AND LEAD COUNSEL</b><br></div>
            <div id="response">In a securities fraud class action, the first event is the Court’s appointment of the Lead
                Plaintiff and Lead Counsel. The Plaintiff who files the first Complaint is not entitled to be the
                “Lead Plaintiff” simply by filing a Complaint. The Lead Plaintiff is the representative party who
                acts on behalf of all investor Class members in directing the litigation and is usually the investor
                or small group of investors who have the largest financial loss in the securities at issue during the
                Class Period. The Lead Plaintiff’s selection of counsel to represent the Lead Plaintiff and the
                Class, if approved by the Court, are Lead or Class Counsel.<br></div>

                <br>

                <div id="response"><b>3.  THE AMENDED COMPLAINT IS FILED</b><br></div>
                <div id="response">After the leadership appointment, the Court will set a schedule for the Lead Plaintiff to
                    file a detailed Amended Complaint. Typically, the deadline for this filing is approximately 60
                    days after the Court appoints the Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel. The Amended Complaint is
                    usually much more detailed than the initial Complaint and frequently contains information
                    provided by confidential witnesses as a result of Lead Counsel’s investigation. At Kessler
                    Topaz, our Investigative Services Department assists with this investigation. The Director of the
                    Investigative Services Department, Mr. William Monks, has nearly 30 years of white collar
                    investigative experience as a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent, CPA,
                    CFF, CVA and “Big Four” forensic accountant. As Director, he leads members of the
                    Investigative Services Department which is comprised of highly trained professionals dedicated
                    to investigating fraud, misrepresentation and other acts of malfeasance resulting in harm to
                    investors, as well as other stakeholders.<br></div>

                    <br>

                <div id="response"><b>4.  THE MOTION TO DISMISS</b><br></div>
                <div id="response">Defendants will usually file a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. This means
                    the Defendants will file a document asking the Court to end the case. The Lead Plaintiff will
                    file an opposition to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, explaining why the Amended
                    Complaint contains the requisite facts and information to permit the case to move forward. The
                    Court may set a hearing for this Motion, or it may make a decision based upon the submissions
                    by the parties. If the Court denies the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (which can take 9 – 12
                    months or longer), it means the Court has rejected the Defendants’ request to end the case and is
                    allowing the case to go to the discovery phase. If the Court grants the Defendants’ request, it
                    means the Court has agreed to the Defendants’ request to end the case. Frequently, however, the
                    Court will permit the Lead Plaintiff to file a new Amended Complaint in order to cure any
                    deficiencies identified by the Court in its opinion dismissing the case.<br></div>

                    <br>

                    <div id="response"><b>5.  THE DISCOVERY PHASE AND CLASS CERTIFICATION</b><br></div>
                    <div id="response">The discovery phase is the period of time (typically between 12-18 months) when the
                        Lead Plaintiff and Defendants can request documents and other information (like deposition
                        testimony) from each other. Each side will also engage one or more experts to provide detailed
                        expert reports and testimony, usually concerning the amount of potential damages. One of the
                        purposes of the discovery phase is to enable the Lead Plaintiff to gather evidence (documents
                        and testimony) to support their claims at trial. During this time, the Lead Plaintiff will also file a
                        Motion for Class Certification which, because a large number of people (the Class) have been
                        injured by the same Defendants in the same way and during the same time period (the Class
                        Period), asks the Court to enter an order declaring that the action should proceed to trial as a
                        Class Action.<br></div>


                    <br>

                    <div id="response"><b>6.  PRE-TRIAL MOTIONS AND TRIAL</b><br></div>
                    <div id="response">After the conclusion of the discovery phase, the Court, if it already has not, will typically
                        enter an order setting the deadlines for Pre-Trial motions and Trial. Many times the Court will
                        allow the parties to file a Motion for Summary Judgment. If the Defendants file such a motion,
                        they will ask the Court to end the case by arguing that the undisputed facts do not support a jury
                        finding in favor of the Lead Plaintiff and the Class. The Court will also usually hear motions
                        from the parties asking it not to permit certain evidence from being used at Trial. After that, the
                        case will go to Trial where the jury will decide whether or not the Lead Plaintiff proved the
                        claims by a preponderance of the evidence. This means that the Lead Plaintiff has the burden to
                        prove to the fact finder (the jury) that there is a greater than 50% chance that the claims are true.
                        It is important to note that it is extremely rare for securities class action lawsuits to go all the way
                        through to a jury verdict. Since 1996, there have been fewer than 25 cases that have gone to
                        Trial, or less than 0.5%. Unlike many firms that litigate complex class action securities cases,
                        we at Kessler Topaz do not shy away from the courtroom, and we’re one of very few firms who
                        have taken securities class actions to Trial. Opponents know we have the experience and
                        resources to see a matter through to Trial, and few are willing to put us to the test.<br></div>
